## A reflection on _en plein air._

First and foremost, I decided to work on the Bitsy rooms, as I knew they’d give me the most struggle. I was not very confident in my abilities as a visual artist, but I bought Procreate and a pixel brush set with patterns, which made drawing significantly easier.
Although at first, I used multiple colours for both the room and the sprites, forgetting about the three-colour limit Bitsy has.

After quickly realising that my art would not translate well into Bitsy, I limited myself to their colour palette limit and made the current Bitsy rooms with Procreate. This would prove to be the first hurdle of my project: a big focus in my narrative is on colour, and having such a tight limit on colour in an otherwise more visual program used in the semester I feel lessened the impact it would have on the narrative.
I would then use Pixsy to translate the newly created rooms into Bitsy, and attempt to use Tilesy as a backup, but Pixsy ended up working better for me. I ended up only making three rooms due to time constraints, but it would work out well in the end to show a straightforward growth of the vibrancy of the piece (dull → neutral → bright).

After putting together the rooms and the sprites (I would add the dialogue later), I shifted my focus on the Twine passages since that’s where the bulk of my story lies.

Here is a basic structure I drew of how I imagined the story would progress at first. The black squares are where the Bitsy rooms are, and there would be a shift in narrative focus between the painter (Monet), the restorator (the reader/player), and the painting itself accordingly to the map. The main focus is on the painter’s story and relation to the piece, hence he has the most passages, but I decided to put some focus on the painting and the restorator as well for reliability and to further encompass the ekphratic nature of the work.
I had less trouble with Twine due to my familiarity of it from a previous project, but having to implement new techniques such as a scrolling text effect more akin to a visual novel would provide me with some challenges. Initially, I thought I would have to learn Sugarcube in order to get that effect, but a quick look into the Harlowe handbook quickly taught me how to implement it. Here, I also got the idea to continue using colour in the piece by having the background colour change over the course of the narrative using tags, and to further indicate who the speaker is via different fonts. The restorator is in Montserrat, while the painter is in Bona Nova SC.

I quickly encounter another hurdle here that I, unfortunately, did not have the time to fix. I wanted the player to progress through the story themselves by clicking to reveal new text in each passage, instead of just letting the text scroll by without their prompt. I did this by using (click: ?page)[== after a line I wanted the player to click through, but unfortunately this caused the passage to load very slowly after a couple of times the player was prompted to click. I observed, after researching, that the reason for this is because the macro for the typewriter is lagging behind due to having to process and execute every step for every time it’s prompted. But unfortunately, I could not find a solution, so in some passages the text takes several seconds to show up.
The biggest hurdle would come in the most ambitious part of my project: putting my Bitsy rooms within my Twine passages. At first, I thought simply putting them in an iframe within the Twine passage would work, but no matter how hard I tried, the Bitsy rooms would not show up. They are in my Twine game’s files, in their own Bitsy folder, but Github is unable to find them whenever I run the game’s website. Due to time constraints, I decided to publish each of the Bitsy rooms into their own Github Pages instead, but hopefully for future projects I can finally figure out how to properly combine Bitsy and Twine. I do deeply regret being unable to fix this issue, since I felt it greatly took away from the impact of the narrative.

Overall, I hold some regrets in not having enough time to fix the major issues I had in my final piece, but I am still satisfied with the writing in the final result, and the challenges I faced have helped me learn more about digital writing and where I might want to take my digital works in the future. Combining interactive fiction and ekphrasis was new and refreshing to me, and I would definitely do it again for another piece of art.
