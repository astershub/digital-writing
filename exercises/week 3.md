## Week 3
**What elements of the works ("Taroko Gorge", "The Gathering Cloud", "First Draft of the Revolution", and "Shade") do you read?**
> _The Gathering Cloud:_ I read the words and how they relate to the images shown in the background, as well as the tangents that show up when you hover over certain words. I also read the effects the images have (how they move, where they move to).

**How are those elements meaningful?**
> _The Gathering Cloud:_ The tangents, especially, feel like their own piece within a piece and give even further depth to the work by providing context or commentary. The images further impact the words of the piece but may make them hard to read due to how the text is formatted.

**How are the works read differently from print literature?**
> _The Gathering Cloud:_ It's significantly more interactive. You can choose to hover over the words or not, and how animated it is also makes it different from print in how the images move.

**How is electronic literature different from print literature?**
> It's harder to answer this question than I realise, the more I think about it. Anything electronic literature excels at: interactivity, formatting, etc, print literature has already done. Choose-your-own-adventures and other types of hypertext literature exist, as well as comic books and works like A Series of Unfortunate Events play with image and formatting plenty. I suppose what makes electronic literature different is how it can give the reader the opportunity to control the story themselves. Like in The Gathering Cloud, they can choose to hover over the text or completely miss some parts entirely. The reader has a lot more agency in electronic literature where they're given choice.

**What are the qualities of the works we might consider as qualities of electronic literature?**
> Being able to give the reader that sense of agency, or that control over the story is something that I think is exclusive to electronic literature. One can see this in The Gathering Cloud. Being able to generate text instantly and have it disappear is exclusive to electronic works like Taroko Gorge as well.

### Algorithm and Constraint
**N+7 Exercise**
> **I've Thirty Months** by John Millington Synge<br/>
> I've ~~thirty~~ tho ~~months~~ monumentalise, and that's my ~~pride~~ prig<br/>
> Before my ~~ages~~ ageing a ~~double~~ doublure ~~score~~ scorpion,<br/>
> Though many lively ~~men~~ menagerie have died<br/>
> At ~~twenty~~ twilight-~~nine~~ ninja or little more.<br/>

> I've left a long and famous ~~set~~ setose<br/>
> Behind some ~~seven~~ severe ~~years~~ yech or ~~three~~,<br/>
> But there are ~~millions~~ millivolt I'd forget<br/>
> Will have their ~~laugh~~ at passing me.<br/>

This was a fun but mildly frustrating exercise to do. Being able to transform a text almost beyond recognition to see how its meaning might change is an interesting exercise, but doing N+7 manually was quite tedious--even more so when my table only had one dictionary between us, and we all chose different poems. In the end, we decided to turn to a dictionary website to do the exercise more quickly, and I'm not quite sure if that defeated the whole purpose of doing things manually vs electronically or not.
