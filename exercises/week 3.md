## Week 3
**What elements of the works ("Taroko Gorge", "The Gathering Cloud", "First Draft of the Revolution", and "Shade") do you read?**
> _The Gathering Cloud:_ I read the words and how they relate to the images shown in the background, as well as the tangents that show up when you hover over certain words. I also read the effects the images have (how they move, where they move to).

**How are those elements meaningful?**
> _The Gathering Cloud:_ The tangents, especially, feel like their own piece within a piece and give even further depth to the work by providing context or commentary. The images further impact the words of the piece but may make them hard to read due to how the text is formatted.

**How are the works read differently from print literature?**
> _The Gathering Cloud:_ It's significantly more interactive. You can choose to hover over the words or not, and how animated it is also makes it different from print in how the images move.
