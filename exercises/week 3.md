## Week 3
**What elements of the works ("Taroko Gorge", "The Gathering Cloud", "First Draft of the Revolution", and "Shade") do you read?**
> _The Gathering Cloud:_ I read the words and how they relate to the images shown in the background, as well as the tangents that show up when you hover over certain words. I also read the effects the images have (how they move, where they move to).

**How are those elements meaningful?**
> _The Gathering Cloud:_ The tangents, especially, feel like their own piece within a piece and give even further depth to the work by providing context or commentary. The images further impact the words of the piece but may make them hard to read due to how the text is formatted.

**How are the works read differently from print literature?**
> _The Gathering Cloud:_ It's significantly more interactive. You can choose to hover over the words or not, and how animated it is also makes it different from print in how the images move.

**How is electronic literature different from print literature?**
> It's harder to answer this question than I realise, the more I think about it. Anything electronic literature excels at: interactivity, formatting, etc, print literature has already done. Choose-your-own-adventures and other types of hypertext literature exist, as well as comic books and works like A Series of Unfortunate Events play with image and formatting plenty. I suppose what makes electronic literature different is how it can give the reader the opportunity to control the story themselves. Like in The Gathering Cloud, they can choose to hover over the text or completely miss some parts entirely. The reader has a lot more agency in electronic literature where they're given choice.

**What are the qualities of the works we might consider as qualities of electronic literature?**
> Being able to give the reader that sense of agency, or that control over the story is something that I think is exclusive to electronic literature. One can see this in The Gathering Cloud. Being able to generate text instantly and have it disappear is exclusive to electronic works like Taroko Gorge as well.

### Algorithm and Constraint
**N+7 Exercise**
> **I've Thirty Months** by John Millington Synge<br/>
> I've ~~thirty~~ tho ~~months~~ monumentalise, and that's my ~~pride~~ prig<br/>
> Before my ~~ages~~ ageing a ~~double~~ doublure ~~score~~ scorpion,<br/>
> Though many lively ~~men~~ menagerie have died<br/>
> At ~~twenty~~ twilight-~~nine~~ ninja or little more.<br/>
><br/>
> I've left a long and famous ~~set~~ setose<br/>
> Behind some ~~seven~~ severe ~~years~~ yech or ~~three~~,<br/>
> But there are ~~millions~~ millivolt I'd forget<br/>
> Will have their ~~laugh~~ at passing me.<br/>

This was a fun but mildly frustrating exercise to do. Being able to transform a text almost beyond recognition to see how its meaning might change is an interesting exercise, but doing N+7 manually was quite tedious--even more so when my table only had one dictionary between us, and we all chose different poems. In the end, we decided to turn to a dictionary website to do the exercise more quickly, and I'm not quite sure if that defeated the whole purpose of doing things manually vs electronically or not.

### Dadaist Poem remix
> [Link](https://github.com/astershub/dadaist-poem)

Having never used Glitch before, I felt intimidated learning something new--code, as much as I like to claim I have experience with it, is still quite scary for me to dive into when it's about a program or language I've never tried before. But this proved to be easy enough to navigate and push onto Github, and it turned out to be rather fun to experiment with. I'm thinking I'll give it a go from time to time to see what I can come up with from different articles (or even my own writing).

### N+7 remix
> [Link](https://github.com/astershub/n-7-remix)

The mechanics of the N+7 remix functioned relatively similar to the Dadaist poem, even though the writing techniques themselves were different. I also had fun experimenting with this one.

### Taroko Gorge(s)
**Chosen remix: _Tokyo Garage_**
**What aspects of the remix are the same?**
> Tokyo Garage still generates and randomly pairs certain words the same way Tarako Gorge does, scrolling infinitely once it reaches the bottom of the page and removing the text from the top to make way for new lines.

**What aspects of the remix are different?**
> The colours are different to reflect the subject of Tokyo Garage. Taroko Gorge had earthier colours to reflect the nature it decribes in the piece, while Tokyo Garage has is neon yellow on a black background to depict the nightlife it portrays. The words are different, with talks of Godzilla and Roppongi and racers and police and prostitutes, to reflect the change in topic. While Taroko Gorge aims for a more peaceful experience where the reader is surrounded by nature, Tokyo Garage aims for a more chaotic atmosphere, focusing on the rowdy futuristic nightlife of Japan that's often romanticised.

**Is the remix successful (why or why not)?**
> Tokyo Garage takes something as simple as a change in topic and completely turns the work on its head by reflecting that change in almost every single part of the work except for its main mechanics. The title of it being so similar to Taroko Gorge is clever as well. I think this remix did well in showcasing the simplicity that Taroko Gorge had, because you could take its mechanics to talk about almost anything.
