## Writing Hypertext Fiction
**How is it different from fiction?**
> Its interactivity with the reader and reliance on the reader getting themselves to the end goal is a very important difference between hypertext fiction and fiction. Most fiction is linear and while it can be immersive, it's ultimately not very interactive with the reader. Hypertext fiction provides interaction and gives the player some control.

**How is it different from games?**
> Many games aren't very narrative-focused and focus much more on gameplay mechanics, no matter the story behind those mechanics. I think that's the key difference between hypertext fiction and games. Hypertext fiction's main objective is still to get the reader to experience the story; games aim to get the player to focus on the mechanics.

**How do you plan fiction?**
> While I tend to be all over the place when planning fiction, it ends up being a rather linear process. I think about the beginning, middle and end of the story, and I admittedly think less about the reader. I, of course, think about how they may enjoy it more and what I can do to prevent them from putting my work down, but since my goal is to immerse and not interact, I plan with the goal of getting the reader to the end without thinking about how they may get there.

**How could you plan hypertext fiction?**
> Of course, with hypertext fiction, I have to very carefully consider _how_ my reader will get to the end (or _an_ end if there's multiple). Having that additional criteria proves more difficult, as well as planning while being aware of the reader's interactions with the work.
