## Inform 7 exercise
[Link](https://github.com/astershub/inform-7)
> As this was the first time I'd heard of Inform 7, I was both intimidated and excited to try it out. It proved to be quite simple to use with the code already given to me in the exercise, but writing something new was more difficult. Learning a completely new program definitely takes some time to get used to, especially with the language you have to use to get Inform 7 to work properly, but I am interested to see what kind of works I can produce with this, even if simplistic.

## Bitsy exercise

> Having heard of Bitsy before (due to game dev friends having tried it in previous projects) but never attempted it, I was beyond excited to finally try it, and was delighted at how fun yet surprisingly simple it was. It's still rather intimidating to navigate, don't get me wrong, and I definitely don't claim to be a visual artist in any shape or form, but I had plenty of fun
