> Having played with Glitch three times now, I have become rather familiar with its interface, and We Walk To You was yet another work I had fun experimenting with. This led me to wonder if I could make my own work on Glitch for people to experiment with and make their own, but I would have to be more proficient in HTML first before trying it out.
