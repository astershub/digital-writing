## Week 1
**What types of writing do you do (e.g. fiction, nonfiction, poetry)?**
> Mostly nonfiction & poetry, some fiction as well (mostly collaborative work if fiction). I also have experience with screenwriting and scriptwriting

**What tools or techniques do you use to write?**
> Mostly just word documents and pure prose, maybe “spicing up” the text via formatting tools (italicise, bold, paragraph styles, etc). I have experience with Twine for more interactive works (or works with ‘choices’ or ‘different endings’), and I do have RPG Maker. I also use code sometimes, particularly in more collaborative writing (e.g. roleplaying), mainly HTML, CSS and BBCode. Handwriting is much more rare but I do write handwritten works sometimes

**Why do you use these tools or techniques?**
> I’m very interested in the forms I can write, and particularly how to make my writing a more visual experience (in regards to formatting or just how the writing is presented visually other than paragraphs on a page), so any tool I can use to experiment I will try

**How do these tools shape the way you write (e.g. constrain the way you write or facilitate your writing)?**
> For simple word documents, there’s a lot more restriction in that they can only do so much formatting wise? And for programs like Twine and coding languages like CSS they’re much more intimidating to learn, and I’m still not an expert at either.
